Assumptions that were made:

- As per the wording of step 4 in the interview question, I have stored the data manually in a data.json file rather than using an observable to extract and modify information every time the application launches
- Multiple functionality has been commented out for archiving purposes and to show my process in developing a solution
- The template referred to in step 5 was specifically for the results section shown in the screenshot

To Do's If I were to continue development:

- Instead of manually storing the data.json, develop a function to write into the data.json whenever new data is detected
- Either add a user button to modify data.json into dataModified.json, or make the process automatic
- Modify the template to look more like the full page linked rather than just the results list, including sidebar, header, pagination
